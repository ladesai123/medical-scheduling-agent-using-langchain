### 3. LangChain Tools Implementation

#### Core Medical Tools
1. **`search_patient`**: Advanced patient lookup with fuzzy matching
2. **`get_available_doctors`**: Specialty-filtered doctor search
3. **`check_doctor_availability`**: Real-time availability checking
4. **`book_appointment_enhanced`**: Full booking with notifications
5. **`get_calendar_availability`**: Detailed slot availability
6. **`reschedule_appointment`**: Smart rescheduling with confirmations
7. **`cancel_appointment`**: Appointment cancellation with notifications
8. **`validate_insurance`**: Insurance carrier and member ID validation
9. **`get_patient_appointments`**: Patient appointment history
10. **`export_appointments_to_excel`**: Administrative data export
11. **`send_reminder_now`**: Manual reminder trigger

### 4. Fallback System Architecture

#### Multi-Level Degradation
1. **Level 1**: Full LangChain Agent with OpenAI API
2. **Level 2**: Enhanced Mock LangChain Agent (rule-based with business logic)
3. **Level 3**: Basic SchedulerAgent with OpenAI client
4. **Level 4**: Simple rule-based MockLLM

#### MockLangChainAgent (`app/agents/mock_langchain_agent.py`)
- **Enhanced Rule-Based Logic**: Intelligent response generation
- **Business Feature Integration**: Full calendar and notification support
- **Specialty Matching**: Doctor specialty detection and matching
- **Appointment Workflows**: Complete booking, rescheduling, and cancellation

### 5. User Interface Improvements

#### Streamlit Web Interface
- **Professional Healthcare Theme**: Medical-focused UI design
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive conversation with AI agent
- **Quick Actions**: One-click scheduling buttons
- **System Status**: Agent type and health monitoring
- **Sample Commands**: User guidance and examples
- **Admin Features**: Data generation and export capabilities

#### CLI Interface
- **Agent Detection**: Automatic selection of best available agent
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed system status and error tracking
- **Graceful Handling**: Smooth degradation on API failures
